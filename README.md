# Profit Prophet

## Challenge
Financial institutions need to accurately identify borrowers who are likely to default on their loans to reduce risk and maintain portfolio health.

## Goal
Develop a predictive model that classifies borrowers as potential defaulters or non-defaulters, enhancing lenders' ability to assess creditworthiness while mitigating risks.

## Approach
This project involves comprehensive data analysis and machine learning model development. It uses a dataset containing borrower information, including loan details (type, amount, interest rates, terms), personal factors (employment, income, credit scores), and demographics (gender, marital status, education).

## Expected Outcome
The goal is to create a reliable classification system that helps lenders make informed lending decisions and minimize financial losses.

## Presentation Scope
This notebook explores the complete predictive modeling process, including comprehensive data analysis and model-building methodologies used to achieve the classification objectives.
